# 👋 Hi, I'm Kacper B.

I'm a **freelance software developer** focused on building robust and lightweight **APIs in Python** using **Flask**.  
Currently working on a set of reusable components and backend services for real-world applications.

In the near future, I plan to expand into **desktop apps** (Windows Forms) and **mobile development** (Android) — all integrated with my APIs.
